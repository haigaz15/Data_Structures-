IncreasingDecreasingArray Discription:
•	We have an integer array the elements of which are initially increasing up to some index i, and they are decreasing starting from index i. Let's call this index the peak. Write an efficient method/function that, given such an array, determines the peak index i. Write a program that inputs the elements of an array (note that the array size is not given) and uses your method to output the peak index.

InOrder Discription:
•	Write a program that inputs an array arr of n elements and outputs the number of pairs of elements that are in-order. We will call a pair of elements arr[i] and arr[j] in-order if i < j and arr[i] < arr[j]. 

InsertionSortRec Discription:
•	Modify the insertion sort algorithm by replacing the main loop with recursion.

ModifiedQuickSort Discription:
•	Modify the quick-sort algorithm to rely on a randomly chosen pivot.

DetermineTheUniqueElement Discription:
•	We have two arrays: B and N. The B array contains elements, such as "b3" and "b26" and the N array contains elements like "n3" and "n26". The pair "b4" and "n4" is called a matching pair, while the pair "b10" and "n17" is not. All the elements in N have a unique match from B. But there is a single extra element e0 in B that doesn't have any matches in N. The input is k, where k = jNj, the elements of B and the elements of N. Write an ecient program that receives this input and prints the value e0.

Linked List1 and Linked list folder Discriptions: 
•	Write a method/function that, given the head node of a singly linked list of char elements, prints every second element in the list. You need to write a program to test your method/function.
