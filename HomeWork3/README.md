Question 1 Description:
 Implement bubble sort for a doubly linked list of integers. Your bubble sort method/function should receive only the header node of the list. Write a program that (i) constructs a doubly linked list of integers, (ii) calls your method to bubble sort the list, and (iii) prints the sorted sequence. Your method should not access or use any of the data/methods of the DoublyLinkedList class. Thus, the nested Node class must be declared public for use outside of the DoublyLinkedList class.



Question 2 Discription:
 Extend the CircularlyLinkedList class with a method/function that implements the removeLast operation for a circularly linked list. 



Question 3 Discription:
Implement the Deque ADT using a circular array. Note that all operations should have O(1) running time. Your ArrayDeque class should implement the Deque interface.



Question 4 Discription:
Suppose you have two nonempty stacks S and T and a doubly linked list D. Write an ecient method/function that uses D to modify S to store all the original elements of both S and T, and to make T empty. In the resulting S, the
original elements of S should go above all of the original elements of T. Note that both sets of elements should still be in their original order.
